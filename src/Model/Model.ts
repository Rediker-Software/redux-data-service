/**
 * # Model
 *
 * The Model class is a helper for working with data associated to a DataService.
 *
 * ## Immutability
 *
 * Properties on the Model should use the `@attr` decorator for specifying fields specific to the Model's own data.
 * It is these values which will be sent to/from the API via the DataService when the Model is instantiated or saved.
 *
 * Since the DataService is tied to Redux, and *data in Redux must be immutable*, this class is immutable.
 * However, it will use a magic setter on each decorated field which will dispatch a Redux action to the DataService's reducer.
 * When the reducer receives the value for the new field, a new instance of the Model will be stored and the current Model instance will
 * be marked for destruction. Thus, we preserve the nature of an immutable architecture, with the convenience of a traditional MVC framework.
 *
 * ## Decorators
 *
 * ### @attr
 * Use this decorator to specify which properties on the model are a part of the model's own data, which will be sent to/from the API.
 * It takes a `FieldType`, from which we can determine the property's default value, default validation rules and how to render it dynamically.
 * You may optionally provide a second parameter, to specify a different default value for the property being decorated. To set
 * additional validation rules for the property, use the `@validation` decorator or one of its variants, such as `@required`.
 *
 * ### @validation
 * Use this decorator to specify additional validation rules on the property being decorated. Should be used in conjunction with `@attr`.
 * The format of the object passed into the decorator should match the validation rules for [Validate.JS](https://validatejs.org/).
 *
 * ### @required
 * Use this decorator as a convenience for setting a validation rule to specify that a property is required.
 *
 * ### @belongsTo
 * Use this decorator to specify a relationship to another Model such that this Model has one of the related Model. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * @belongsTo()
 * organization: IOrganization;
 * ```
 *
 * The above example will use the property name to identify the name of the related field's service (which can be specified as the first parameter).
 * It will use a standard naming convention to identify the name of the field on this Model for identifying the ID of the related model to load,
 * in this case it would look for a field named "organizationId" to load the related IOrganization from the "organization" DataService. The relatedFieldName
 * can be specified as the second parameter.
 *
 * The DataService will return an Observable which will provide new copies of the related Model every time it is updated. If the related Model has not
 * been loaded yet, the DataService will load it and return a "shadow" object while it is loading.
 *
 * ### @hasMany
 * Use this decorator to specify a relationship to another Model such that this Model has many of the related Model. It behaves the exact
 * same as the `@belongsTo` decorator, except it assumes the relatedFieldName is pluralized and it returns arrays of the related Model instead.
 *
