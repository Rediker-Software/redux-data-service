# Interface: IFieldRelationship

This is the meta-data about a related field on a `Model`, such as a `BelongsTo` or `HasMany` field. It enables us to lazy-load the related model(s) given a field which specifies the related ID(s) and the related service name.

For example, field "student" relates to the "student" service through the "studentId" relatedFieldName.
